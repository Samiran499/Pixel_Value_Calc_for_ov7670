This is the code for the fresh year project for the Avonics Trainee's of IITB Rocket Team. The project was to find the bright light spot from a flashlight shone on the wall using an OmniVision OV7670 camera module with an Arduino UNO and move a bot towards its direction. This repo contains a stripped down version of indrek's code for streaming video from ov7670 to pc (and for visuals from the camera I suggest using his ArduImageCapture tool), which was actually stripped down by jjbel from whom this repo was originally forked. I edited the code for determining the brighest section of the frame capture by camera. Basically it captures the half of the upperframe (because it worked well for me), and stores the pixel values from left to right in five columns. It uses an algorithm based on weighted average technique for determinig the direction the bot should go. For now, it's still has to be a bit optimized for UNO.
